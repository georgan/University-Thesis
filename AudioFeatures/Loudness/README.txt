There are comments on the *.m files that describe how to use them. There are also some *.mat files that contain the following:

	- BarkCenters.mat: center frequencies of the bands in Bark Scale (in Hz).
	- BarkScaleLims.mat: upper and lower frequency limits of bands in Bark Scale (in Hz).
	- EqualLoudnessContours.mat: contains two variables: eqlcon is a matrix that contains in each column an equal loudness level as a function of the frequency in BarkCenters. The value of the level is 		given by the corresponding element of phonlevels variable.
