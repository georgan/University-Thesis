Dual Task Instructions

You will make the Primary and Peripheral tasks simultaneously. Concentrate actively on the Primary task(task of counting tones) and try not to listen to the Peripheral task. When you perceive a target at the peripheral task, press the space button. If possible, don't move your attention away from the primary task while you press the button.
